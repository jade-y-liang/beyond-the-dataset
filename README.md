# PIC 16B Blog

Welcome! This blog is part of my coursework for the Program in Computing (PIC) 16B at UCLA. It features a series of tutorials and analyses that explore data science concepts and projects in an engaging and practical way. Topics include data wrangling and visualization, web scraping, web development, image classification, and fake news detection.
