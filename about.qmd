# Beyond the Dataset

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

Welcome to **Beyond the Dataset** - a data science and analytics blog created by me, Jade! 

What began as a platform to publish my coursework from UCLA's Program in Computing (PIC) 16B course has grown into a collection of hands-on projects that explores a wide range of topics. 

### üéØ Goal

This blog serves as a portfolio and a personal learning journal. It's where I showcase projects, tutorials, and analyses while continuing to grow my skills as an aspiring data analyst and data scientist.
