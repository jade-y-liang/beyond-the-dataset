Using web scraping, recipes are collected from allrecipes.com and cleaned to ensure data quality. Advanced machine learning models, such as GPT-2 and BERT, are further employed to generate AI-based recipes and predict cooking times using textual recipe instructions. The application integrates these features with a user-friendly interface developed using Dash.\n","\n","Data cleaning plays a critical role in standardizing recipe information, such as unifying time units, extracting key ingredients, and estimating missing cooking times. This step ensures the dataset is well-structured for machine learning models, enabling accurate recipe recommendations and cooking time predictions. The app's interactivity allows users to select ingredients, set time or calorie preferences, and view both AI-generated and sourced recipes in an organized layout.\n","\n","Overall, the No-Plan Pantry project combines data science, natural language processing, and intuitive design to create an innovative tool that empowers users to cook creatively while reducing food waste.\n","\n","Here is the [link](https://github.com/jade-y-liang/no-plan-pantry) to our GitHub repository."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c57cd9e2","metadata":{"id":"c57cd9e2"},"source":["![Project Overview](flowchart.png \"Title\")"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5e68c02d","metadata":{"id":"5e68c02d"},"source":["# Web Scraping `allrecipes.com`"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"lZ1n1aJv-UjO","metadata":{"id":"lZ1n1aJv-UjO"},"source":["To effectively scrape recipe data from `allrecipes.com`, we used `scrapy`, which is known to be efficient at web scraping. `scrapy`’s ensures fast performance even when dealing with large volumes of data, thus making it an ideal choice for our needs.
